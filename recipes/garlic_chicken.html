        <li>Yields: 2-4 servings</li>
        <li>Prep time: 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook time: 20-25 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs (about 1.5 lbs total)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh herbs, chopped (such as rosemary, thyme, parsley, or a mix)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon olive oil (to prevent sticking)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). And have a large oven-safe skillet (cast iron works great) ready.</li>
        <li>Prepare the garlic herb butter: In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, chopped fresh herbs, salt, and pepper. Mix well until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Prepare the chicken: Pat the chicken breasts or thighs dry with paper towels. This helps them brown better.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken: Place the chicken in a baking dish (for oven method) or the skillet (for stovetop method). Spread the garlic herb butter evenly over the top of each piece of chicken. If using the stovetop method, you can drizzle a little olive oil in the skillet first to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). And heat the skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until nicely browned. Then, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the skillet, and cook for another 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F/74°C).</li>
        <li>Rest (optional but recommended): Once cooked, let the chicken rest for 5-10 minutes before slicing. This helps the juices redistribute, resulting in more tender chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve the garlic herb butter chicken hot.</li>
    </ol>
