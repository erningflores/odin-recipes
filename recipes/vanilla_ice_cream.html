    <p>Imagine you are doing a low carbohydrates diet and you can still eat an ice cream.</p>
    <p>This recipe uses a "no-churn" method, so you don't need any special equipment!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yields: About 4 servings</li>
        <li>Prep time: 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Freeze time: At least 4 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (full fat)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered erythritol or your preferred powdered low-carb sweetener </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tablespoon of vodka or other clear alcohol (helps prevent it from freezing rock solid, you won't taste it)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chill a container: Place a freezer-safe container (glass or plastic) in the freezer while you prepare the mixture.</li>
        <li>Combine ingredients: In a medium bowl, combine the heavy whipping cream, powdered sweetener, vanilla extract, and salt. If using, add the vodka.</li>
        <li>Whip until stiff peaks form: Use an electric mixer (handheld or stand mixer) to whip the mixture until stiff peaks form, similar to whipped cream. This incorporates air and helps create a creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Transfer to chilled container: Pour the whipped cream mixture into the chilled freezer-safe container.</li>
        <li>Freeze: Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap (pressing it directly onto the surface of the ice cream to prevent ice crystals) and freeze for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, until solid</li>
        <li>Soften and serve: Before serving, let the ice cream sit at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes to soften slightly for easier scooping.</li>
    </ol>
