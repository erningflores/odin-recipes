    <p>Laswa is a simple yet nutritious and flavorful vegetable soup popular in the Ilonggo region of the Philippines. It's a dish that highlights the freshness of local vegetables and is very versatile, allowing for variations based on what's available and in season. Here's a basic recipe to guide you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yields: 4-6 servings</li>
        <li>Prep time: 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook time: 20-25 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4-5 cups water</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced (optional, but adds flavor)</li>
        <li>1-2 small tomatoes, sliced or quartered</li>
        <li>1 cup cubed kalabasa (squash)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cubed gabi (taro root), peeled (optional, but adds thickness)</li>
        <li>4-5 pieces medium okra, ends trimmed and cut in half</li>
        <li>1 cup sitaw (string beans), cut into 2-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1 small patola (sponge gourd), peeled and sliced into rounds (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup saluyot leaves (jute leaves)</li>
        <li>1 cup alugbati leaves (Malabar spinach)</li>
        <li>1 stalk malunggay leaves (moringa leaves) </li>
        <li>1-2 stalks tanglad (lemongrass), white part only, bruised and tied into a knot (optional, for aroma)</li>
        <li>Salt or fish sauce (patis) to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: Shrimp (small, whole shrimp or shrimp bouillon cube for added flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the base: In a pot, bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add aromatics and root vegetables: Add the sliced onion, minced garlic (if using), sliced tomatoes, cubed kalabasa, and cubed gabi (if using). If using lemongrass, add the tied knot as well. Bring it back to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the kalabasa and gabi start to soften.</li>
        <li>Add other vegetables: Add the okra and sitaw. Continue to simmer for another 3-5 minutes, or until they are tender-crisp. If using patola, add it now and cook for another 2-3 minutes until just tender.</li>
        <li>Add leafy greens: Add the saluyot, alugbati, and malunggay leaves. Stir gently and cook for just 1-2 minutes until the leaves wilt. Be careful not to overcook the leafy greens.</li>
        <li>Season: Season the laswa with salt or fish sauce to your taste. If using shrimp or a shrimp bouillon cube, add it earlier with the kalabasa to allow the flavor to meld into the broth.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Remove from heat and serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
