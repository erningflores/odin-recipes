        <li>1-2 cups okra, ends trimmed</li>

        <li>Whole peppercorns to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: 2-3 green chili peppers (siling haba), for a mild heat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the Pork: In a large pot, combine the pork, water (or broth), onion, garlic, ginger, lemongrass (if using), and whole peppercorns</li>
        <li>Simmer for Tenderness: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the pork is very tender. Skim off any scum that rises to the surfac</li>
        <li>Add Daikon Radish and Green Beans: Add the sliced daikon radish and green beans to the pot. Simmer for about 10 minutes, or until they start to become tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add Okra and Eggplant (if using): Add the okra and eggplant pieces. Continue to simmer for another 5-7 minutes until they are tender.</li>
        <li>Tamarind Paste: Stir in the tamarind paste and adjust the amount to your desired sourness. Simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Leafy Greens and Chili Peppers (if using): Stir in the chopped spinach, kangkong, or pechay, and the green chili peppers (if using). Cook for just 2-3 minutes until the leafy greens are wilted.</li>
        <li>Season: Season the Sinigang with salt or fish sauce (patis) to your taste. Start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve Hot: Remove the lemongrass before serving. Ladle the low-carb Sinigang na Baboy into bowls and serve hot with steamed cauliflower rice or enjoy as is.</li>
