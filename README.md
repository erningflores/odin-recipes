# odin-recipes

I learned the following on the odin project.

1. The boilerplate code for html.
2. There are 6 headers ranging from h1 to h6 tags.
3. There is a paragraph tag p.
4. There is an anchor tag a. You need to add the href attribute which contains the link. Make sure to add the rel attribute which contains noopener and noreferrer for safety purposes.
5. There is an image tag img. You have to add the src and alt attribute. You can set the width and length of this image too.
6. There is also an ordered list ol and an unordered list ul. Both contains a list item li.
7. I also learned more about git. Like for example the git status, git add, git commit, git push, git log, git clone. There is also the proper way to commit in git.
8. I also learned how to searched in google like using quotation marks and the minus sign to search for something specific and eliminate some of it.
