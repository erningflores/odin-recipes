    <p>Making low-carb bread can be a bit different from traditional bread making, as you'll be using alternative flours that are lower in carbohydrates and often gluten-free. Here's a basic recipe for a low-carb almond flour bread, which is a popular choice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Yields: 1 loaf (about 12-16 slices)</li>
        <li>Prep time: 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Cook time: 50-60 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups blanched almond flour (super fine grind recommended for best texture)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup psyllium husk powder (this is crucial for structure and chewiness)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup melted coconut oil (or olive oil)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven and prepare pan: Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Grease and line an 8x4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, psyllium husk powder, baking powder, and salt until well combined. Ensure there are no clumps of psyllium husk.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs: In a separate large bowl, use an electric mixer (handheld or stand mixer) to beat the eggs on high speed until they have doubled in volume and are light and fluffy (this takes about 3-5 minutes). This step is important for creating airiness in the bread.</li>
        <li>Combine wet ingredients: Gradually beat in the melted coconut oil into the whipped eggs until just combined. Then, slowly beat in the warm water until the mixture is uniform.</li>
        <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on low speed until just combined. 1 Be careful not to overmix. 2 The batter will be quite thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer to pan: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake: Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the top is golden brown and feels firm to the touch. The internal temperature should reach around 200-210째F (93-99째C).</li>
        <li>Cool: Let the bread cool in the pan for at least 10-15 minutes before carefully lifting it out using the parchment paper overhang. Place the loaf on a wire rack to cool completely before slicing. This is important for the texture, as it can be a bit fragile when warm.</li>
    </ol>
